# Random User Generator

This project was developed with `Vue.Js` to help me learn the framework.

In this project I used the Vue.Js CDN to get a quick start on building a small demo.

A default user is displayed, and clicking the `Get Random User button` on the page will generate a new user.

I use the `randomuser.me/api` for the data fetching.
